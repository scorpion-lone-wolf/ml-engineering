# ML LEARNING STATE — Demonstrated Understanding

> Track 1 learner-understanding source of truth. Update the current snapshot as learning progresses; preserve checkpoint/history sections.

## Current Snapshot

- **Track:** Track 1 — Classical ML + Production ML/MLOps
- **State:** NOT STARTED / INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC PENDING
- **Current stage:** Stage 0 — Environment and Engineering Setup
- **Current topic:** First-session diagnostic/setup
- **Last mastered topic:** None recorded yet
- **Unresolved core prerequisite gaps:** None identified yet; diagnostic pending
- **Needs review:** None recorded yet
- **Last updated:** 2026-09-14

## Learner Baseline

### Assume Known

- Core Python programming.
- Basic linear algebra familiarity only.
- Basic calculus familiarity only.

### Do Not Assume

- Probability foundations.
- Statistics foundations.
- Advanced linear algebra/calculus.
- Optimization theory beyond explicitly taught material.
- Any ML concept merely because related mathematics has been seen before.

### Teaching Rule for Mathematics / Statistics

Teach mathematical and statistical prerequisites **inside the ML topic that needs them**, not as a detached math course.

Examples:

- Naive Bayes → conditional probability + Bayes' theorem.
- Logistic regression → sigmoid, likelihood/log-loss, derivatives/gradients as needed.
- Evaluation/experimentation → sampling, bootstrap, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, p-values, Type I/II error, effect size, statistical power.
- PCA → variance/covariance, projection, eigenvectors/eigenvalues, SVD.
- Optimization topics → required derivative/gradient/convexity intuition at point of use.

If a supposedly "basic" linear-algebra/calculus concept is shaky when needed, teach/review it briefly and continue from the paused ML topic.

Use qualitative evidence in notes rather than turning scores into false precision.

## Open Prerequisite Gaps

None recorded yet. Add entries only when an actual gap is demonstrated.

### Gap Entry Template

```markdown
### GAP-XXX — <Concept>
- **Detected in:** Stage/topic
- **Why it blocks progress:**
- **Repair needed:**
- **Evidence required to close:**
- **Status:** OPEN | CLOSED
- **Closed on:**
```

## Misconception Log — Append Only

No misconceptions recorded yet.

Use:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <Misconception>
- What I believed:
- Correct model:
- How it was tested/repaired:
- Recheck date/topic:
```

## Review Queue

No scheduled review items yet.

| Topic | Reason | Review Trigger/Date | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | — | — |

## Topic / Mastery Notes — Append as Topics Close

For important topics, keep compact retention notes:

```markdown
### <Topic>
- Problem it solves:
- Core intuition:
- Key math/statistics:
- Assumptions:
- Failure mode:
- Implementation pattern:
- Evaluation concern:
- Engineering implication:
- Evidence/project where used:
```

---

## Exact Continuation Point

### Next Teaching Step

Run the first-session diagnostic required by `ML/ML_CURRICULUM.md` without retesting core Python as a standalone prerequisite. Establish SQL/ML/statistics-probability/Linux-Git/Docker-cloud/study constraints, then enter Stage 0.

### Practice Before/With Next Lesson

No prerequisite homework is assumed before the diagnostic. After calibration, begin the Stage 0 environment/repository setup deliverable.
